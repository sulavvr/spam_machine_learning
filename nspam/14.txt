The line of thunderstorms currently in Arkansas will continue to move rapidly to the east. It should be near or east of the Mississippi River by 2 PM. A Tornado Watch covers central and eastern Arkansas until 2 PM. Chances for severe weather will decrease markedly after the line of storms passes a given area.

Damaging thunderstorm winds will be the main severe weather threat. In the eastern part of the state, we may see some reports of winds exceeding 70 mph. There is also a threat of isolated tornadoes. The atmosphere is more unstable the farther east you go in Arkansas, so I expect we will see the storms increase in intensity in eastern Arkansas. This will be a fairly rare occurrence for Arkansas in that the severe weather will occur during school hours.

Flash Flood Watches cover a large part of the state. The heaviest rain will occur as the line of storms sweeps through, with some spots picking up 1 to 2 inches of rain in just an hour or two. Thus, street flooding will occur in some places.
