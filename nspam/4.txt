The Banner System will be unavailable from 5:00 pm Friday, Oct 30 until 8:00 am Tuesday, Nov 3 to complete required upgrades to the system.  In the event the upgrades are completed earlier, the system will be restored as early as possible.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

This maintenance requires Banner INB, Banner SS, Discoverer, Travel and Expense, and Effort Certification to be down during this time.

Thank you for your patience during the upgrades to the Banner System.

This will not affect Blackboard, MyCampus or the AState Website.  It will only affect Banner.
