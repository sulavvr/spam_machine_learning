All in computer science MS program,

If you admitted in fall 2014 or later, and if you have discrete
structures as one of your prerequisites (see the checksheet you got in
the orientation), we will offer an exam during this winter break.  (We
will try this time only).  If you pass, we will waive your requirement
of discrete structures.  For all the prerequisites (such as Operating
Systems, Computer Organization, Discrete Structures, Applied
Statistics), you should try to complete in the first year.
