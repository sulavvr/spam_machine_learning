All who take comprehensive exam,

No calculator is needed for the exam.  No computer, no smart phone.
For the first name beginning A to P, you will be assigned to room 209.
Others will be assigned to room 211 to take the exam.  To make sure
which room you should go, please check your name on the door before
you enter the classroom.

Again, you need to come in at 8:00 to take the exam.   There is no make-up exam.

Good luck.
