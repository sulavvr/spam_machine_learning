My apologies for yesterday.  I was ill and unable to make it to class.  

For those taking comprehensives, I will give you your tests early for you to use to  prepare for the exam.  I will be in my office at noon on Friday to distribute tests.  If you want to pick up your tests don't be any later than 1pm.
