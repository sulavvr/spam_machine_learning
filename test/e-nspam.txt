Mizzou Protests Pick Up Steam; Football Team on Strike
Student groups at the University of Missouri have for months criticized President Timothy Wolfe's handling of racial tensions on campus. The turmoil came to a head this weekend when players on the school's football team said they wouldn't play until Wolfe resigned or was fired. The university system's Board of Curators was due to hold a special meeting Monday morning, as graduate students threatened a walkout.
